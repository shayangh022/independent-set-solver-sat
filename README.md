# independent-set-solver-sat
This Python project solves the Independent Set Problem using SAT solving techniques with the PySAT toolkit.  It reads a graph from a .clq file (DIMACS format), builds a CNF representation of the problem, solves it using the Minisat22 backend, and compares the solver's runtime to the theoretical brute-force complexity.
